HMM:
-optimize for GPU and theano(check fns return numpy etc... n types of float 64)
x-log probability domain
x-NeuralNetwork inclusion
- Implementation of PER calc.

DBN-DNN:
x- Fix Validation and test set
x- Fix MFCC
-x- Fix GRBM
- Make the code Modular (for future change)
- Map from 61 phonemes to 39
- Add pickle
- get the best hyperparameters
- Maybe try MMI for finetuning.
x- expand input




Theoretical study of multi-level representations:
- Speaker independence?
- Noise in higher levels ?
